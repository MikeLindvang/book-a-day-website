        You log into your KDP dashboard. Check if there are any yellow

          Anything to indicate someone has read or even just noticed that you
          have a book out.
        </strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        If you‚Äôve just recently published your book you‚Äôre likely to spend a lot
        of time on the screen refreshing the page.

        <em>Of course, it might be different for you.</em>

        Why Does That @#¬§?&@! Book
        <br />
        Pop Up All The Damn Time?!?!?!
      </Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        July 24, 2012, I published my first book of this particular type.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        That‚Äôs almost 8 years ago at the time of this writing.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <strong>Since then I‚Äôve published dozens of books.</strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Whenever I publish a new book I‚Äôm always that bit more attentive to the
        KDP sales dashboard.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        And every time I‚Äôm excitedly monitoring the progress of my latest
        publication.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <strong>
          And almost without fail that damn 8-year-old book pops up with new
          sales.
        </strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Now, I realize I‚Äôm sounding like a spoiled brat complaining about book
        sales.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>But I like my stats to look clean.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        And the truth is, these days it just makes me happy.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Back then, though, I was still learning how to create books that could
        get sales and it was kind of annoying seeing the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù book make
        sales.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <strong>
          Now, what‚Äôs really annoying is how long it took me to learn my lesson.
        </strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        If that type of book makes sales over and over... Do more of those.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Especially when creating this type of book takes significantly less
        effort than most books.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>These days I‚Äôve taken the lesson to heart.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Realizing that the book has generated more than $300 worth of royalties
        made it easier to do.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <strong>
          Especially when I only spent a couple of hours putting it together.

      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Both are victims of a set of publishing myths.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        One of the myths is that in order to publish something it has to be
        perfect.

        A way that you can start building an income from your publishing.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <strong>
          A method that doesn‚Äôt require you to work for months to get a book
          published.
        </strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>It won‚Äôt let you quit your day job right away.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>And probably not for a while.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>But it will allow you to slowly build an income.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <strong>To (FINALLY) see results...</strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Not results you have to wait for years to see.</Paragraph>

          you will start to see more and more of those wonderful yellow bars

      <Paragraph>None of these books will bring in huge numbers.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Heck! Some won‚Äôt make a dime.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        I‚Äôm a family man. That means Christmas is just about the busiest time of
        the year imaginable.{' '}
        <strong>
          And most publishing ventures almost always have to take a backseat to
          all the other crap that‚Äôs going on around that time of year.
        </strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        This year I decided I still wanted to do something for my publishing
        business.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <strong>How?!?!?!?!</strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>I squeezed in about 20 minutes for research.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        At night when the rest of the family was sound asleep I snuck in 30
        minutes here and there to get the actual writing done.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Finally, I tossed a cover together real quick.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <strong>In total I spent 2, maybe 3, hours.</strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Lo and behold! My book was done!</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        <strong>That‚Äôs how easy it is!</strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        I need to be as clear about this as possible. There are no guarantees
        with this system.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>None.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>You may not make anything at all.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>But your odds are sure as shit improving!</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        And chances are, if you stick to it, that you will start seeing yellow
        bars.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>You may even hit the bestseller charts.</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Maybe only the free charts..., but that‚Äôs still better than nothing.

        <strong>It‚Äôs a start.</strong>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Get more and more books on the market and you go from no bars to blue
        bars to yellow bars.
